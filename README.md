# LLM Language Learning

A collection of interactive tools that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for language learning, created by Larry Grullon-Polanco. This application uses OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini API to create research-informed language learning experiences.

## Features

The app offers three main tools designed based on Second Language Acquisition (SLA) research principles:

### 1. Conversation Dictionary (üí¨)
Generate contextual dialogues featuring specific vocabulary words. Select your target language, proficiency level (CEFR), and context to see target vocabulary used naturally in authentic conversations. This approach is supported by research showing vocabulary learning is more effective when words are encountered in meaningful contexts.

### 2. Comprehnsible-izer (üìñ)
Simplify texts based on learner proficiency level, making content more accessible while preserving meaning. Words are color-coded according to their frequency/difficulty level based on standard word family lists. This tool implements Krashen's comprehensible input hypothesis and draws on readability assessment research.

### 3. Art Gallery (üñºÔ∏è)
A game where users practice descriptive language by attempting to recreate AI-generated artwork through verbal descriptions. This activity develops descriptive language skills and engages learners with multimodal literacy, helping them convert visual information into language and vice versa.

## Technology

- Uses multiple LLM providers (ChatGPT and Gemini) with a unified interface
- Built with Streamlit for an interactive web experience
- Implements frequency-based word lists with color coding for difficulty visualization
- Customizable by language, proficiency level, and context

## SLA Research Connection

Each tool was designed with SLA research principles in mind, including:
- Contextualized vocabulary acquisition
- Comprehensible input at appropriate levels
- Multimodal literacy development
- Content-based language learning
- Explicit feedback on common errors

This project demonstrates how modern LLM technology can be applied to create effective, research-informed language learning experiences that adapt to individual learner needs.
