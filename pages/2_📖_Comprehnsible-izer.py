1. Choose vocabulary that has more common usage in English.
E.g., replace ‚Äòkin‚Äô with ‚Äòfamily‚Äô, ‚Äòunmistakable‚Äô with ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô
2. Use shorter sentences and paragraphs.
E.g., split long sentences and paragraphs
3. Put a clear agent into the focus of each sentence in the text.
E.g., change ‚Äòit appears that these people‚Äô to ‚Äòthese people appear.‚Äô;
‚Äòadvice is available in the office‚Äô to ‚Äòyou can get advice from the office‚Äô
4. Avoid noun clusters, use more verbs in the text.
E.g., change ‚Äòwe had a discussion‚Äô to ‚Äòwe discussed‚Äô;
‚Äòlong sea journey‚Äô to ‚Äòlong journey at sea‚Äô
5. Use concise structures, remove unnecessary redundancy, and repetition.
E.g., change ‚Äòact where the law permits‚Äô to ‚Äòact within the law‚Äô;
‚Äòbefore you start needing.‚Äô to ‚Äòbefore you need.‚Äô
6. Elaborate on the points in the text, which are stated implicitly, and which are essential for the meaning-making of the text.
E.g., change ‚Äòsocial work service-user‚Äô to ‚Äòperson in need of social services‚Äô
7. Add words with emotional connotations and time references to help the reader relate to the text.
E.g., change ‚Äòdied disillusioned‚Äô to ‚Äòdied with great disappointment‚Äô;
‚Äòvitamins are still called.‚Äô to ‚Äòthese days vitamins are still called.‚Äô
8. Add logical connectives and links between sentences.
I. Rets et al. / English for Specific Purposes 68 (2022) 31‚Äì46 43
E.g., change ‚ÄòI will read the literature and prepare the draft‚Äô to ‚ÄòFirst, I will read the literature. Then I will prepare the draft‚Äô.
9. Resolve references in the text by replacing pronouns with the corresponding nouns.
E.g., change ‚Äòthose at sea‚Äô to ‚Äòsailors‚Äô
10. Reposition parts of the sentence in a way that clarifies the logical development of the text for the reader.
E.g., change ‚Äòalthough he tried to. he was unable to do so‚Äô to ‚Äòhe was unsuccessful in. although he tried‚Äô.
