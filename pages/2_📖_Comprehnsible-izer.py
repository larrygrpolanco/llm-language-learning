1. Choose vocabulary that has more common usage in English.
E.g., replace ‘kin’ with ‘family’, ‘unmistakable’ with ‘correct’
2. Use shorter sentences and paragraphs.
E.g., split long sentences and paragraphs
3. Put a clear agent into the focus of each sentence in the text.
E.g., change ‘it appears that these people’ to ‘these people appear.’;
‘advice is available in the office’ to ‘you can get advice from the office’
4. Avoid noun clusters, use more verbs in the text.
E.g., change ‘we had a discussion’ to ‘we discussed’;
‘long sea journey’ to ‘long journey at sea’
5. Use concise structures, remove unnecessary redundancy, and repetition.
E.g., change ‘act where the law permits’ to ‘act within the law’;
‘before you start needing.’ to ‘before you need.’
6. Elaborate on the points in the text, which are stated implicitly, and which are essential for the meaning-making of the text.
E.g., change ‘social work service-user’ to ‘person in need of social services’
7. Add words with emotional connotations and time references to help the reader relate to the text.
E.g., change ‘died disillusioned’ to ‘died with great disappointment’;
‘vitamins are still called.’ to ‘these days vitamins are still called.’
8. Add logical connectives and links between sentences.
I. Rets et al. / English for Specific Purposes 68 (2022) 31–46 43
E.g., change ‘I will read the literature and prepare the draft’ to ‘First, I will read the literature. Then I will prepare the draft’.
9. Resolve references in the text by replacing pronouns with the corresponding nouns.
E.g., change ‘those at sea’ to ‘sailors’
10. Reposition parts of the sentence in a way that clarifies the logical development of the text for the reader.
E.g., change ‘although he tried to. he was unable to do so’ to ‘he was unsuccessful in. although he tried’.
